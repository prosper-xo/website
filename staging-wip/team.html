                Our founder is a lifelong artist who began performing and writing music in second grade. She went on to
                attend
                Berklee College of Music as a songwriting major, minoring in music business, and has spent her entire
                career working
                at the intersection of creativity, advocacy, and innovation. Based in Austin, TX, she also founded a
                local organization
                that connects the arts community with social justice movements bridging the gap between music and
                meaningful change.
                With experience directing large-scale community activations, booking festivals, managing artists, and
                navigating the
                music tech startup world, she brings a deep understanding of both the artistic journey and the business
                behind it.
                Her work extends to political advocacy for artists, and her lived experience gives her deep insight into
                what it
                means to survive as an artist and as a business. She's using that knowledge to build a more sustainable
                future and
                tools for the creative community.

                    Our AI Engineer and Full Stack Developer is more than just a technologist—he's also a working artist
                    who
                    intimately understands the challenges of the creator economy and the ways traditional tech continues
                    to leave
                    artists behind. That shared frustration is part of what brought us together to build Prosper XO. He
                    brings with
                    him a deep generational connection to creative culture and community. His grandparents owned a
                    community-run
                    dance hall, a hub for music, movement, and gathering. His father, a professional magician, taught
                    him the
                    business and technological side of being an artist: the hustle, the strategy, and the lack of
                    support creatives
                    often face. His lived experience with art, family legacy, community, and technology gives him a
                    unique and
                    powerful lens on what we're building.

                    Our startup and entertainment lawyer has represented artists fighting for ownership of their data,
                    worked with music industry professionals to navigate complex contract structures, and brings deep
                    knowledge of business formation and IP protection. As someone with a family rooted in the arts, he's
                    personally committed to building a fairer future for creatives—and does it every day.

                    We're a team of artists, engineers, legal advocates, and creative technologists who have lived
                    inside the music industry on both sides of the equation. We've been the performers, the managers,
                    the promoters, the designers, and the people chasing after checks after giving everything to our
                    craft. We've seen the beauty of the creative community, and also the burnout, the broken systems,
                    and the lack of ownership and devaluation artists face every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to our core team, we're supported by a growing group of advisors ranging from high-level
                    corporate technology leaders to experts on the ground floor of the music and creative industries.
                    Their insight helps guide both our long-term strategy and our day-to-day product development,
                    ensuring we stay rooted in both innovation and reality.

                    We didn’t just come together to build an app; we came together to build a sustainable future for the
                    artist. Prosper XO is about shifting power back to the creators. We believe that when artists
                    prosper, culture thrives. That’s why we’re building Prosper XO together.
